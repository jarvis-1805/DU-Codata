Extended BAKERY dataset
This dataset extends the BAKERY? dataset with more information.

Brief outline. A bakery chain has a menu of about 40 pastry items and 10 coffee drinks. It has a number of locations in West Coast states (California, Oregon, Arizona, Nevada).

The database consists of five tables:

Goods: list of pastries and drinks on the menu
Location: list of bakery locations
Employee: list of employees working for the chain
Receipts: list of sales (receipts)
Items: list of purchased items (each receipt can have more than one)
