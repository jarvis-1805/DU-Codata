### The apply family of functions

# an elegant way to do loops

# apply (arrays - matrices)

# tapply (vectors can be split in different subsets)

# lapply (the whole subfamily is for vectors or lists)
# sapply (user friendly version of lapply)
# vapply (similar to sapply, modified return value)
# replicate (random no. generation)

# rapply (similar to lapply)
# eapply (environment, generates a list)
# mapply (multivariate, similar to apply)
# by (data frames, similar to tapply, factors needed,
#     splits the df and does calculus on subset)
